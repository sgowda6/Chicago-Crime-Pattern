The security status of the location where we live is one of the most critical and important issues for every citizen. 
As most individuals will remember, In order to determine the security status, it is difficult to ignore the crime rate. 
Several variables can affect the incidence of crimes, including time, places, population, level of education, income rate. 
Big Data Analytics project was implemented to provide predictions and exploratory analysis for Chicago Crime Rate Pattern. 
The data was collected from the Chicago data portal spanning from 2017-2020. 
Main goal was set to find the crime trend through the years from which we can know whether the security status in the city is getting better or worse. 
Secondly, what time is relatively more secure and which time period is more dangerous are also important for us. 
Besides, as we all know, different crime types have different levels of harm,  are interested in the proportion of different types of crime.
